# QuickApp AI Development Rules

This folder contains comprehensive development rules and patterns for AI-assisted development with QuickApp.

## Files

- **AI_RULES_OVERVIEW.md** - Start here! Quick reference and overview of all patterns
- **AI_RULES_BACKEND.md** - Complete ASP.NET Core backend patterns and conventions
- **AI_RULES_FRONTEND.md** - Complete Angular frontend patterns and conventions

## How to Use

When using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to extend QuickApp, include this in your prompt:

```
Reference the AI rules files in the ai-rules/ folder:
- ai-rules/AI_RULES_BACKEND.md for ASP.NET Core backend patterns
- ai-rules/AI_RULES_FRONTEND.md for Angular frontend patterns
- ai-rules/AI_RULES_OVERVIEW.md for quick reference

Follow the exact patterns and conventions documented in these files.
```

## Purpose

These rules ensure that AI-generated code:
- ✅ Follows QuickApp's established architecture
- ✅ Maintains consistency across the codebase
- ✅ Inherits security and error handling patterns
- ✅ Reduces the need for rewrites and refactoring

QuickApp provides the foundation. These rules guide AI to fill in features correctly.
